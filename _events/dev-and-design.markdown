Anyone and everyone—if any of these questions apply to you, then come to our event Dev & Design: Harmony in the Digital Space. We’ll start off with an interactive panel discussion where developers and designers together will analyze existing designs and discuss their thoughts on the design; this discussion will present perspectives from both development and design backgrounds. Then we will break out into four roundtable discussion groups, each of which will discuss the following:

* Designers helping developers on the best way to design their portfolio 
* Developers helping designers get their portfolio up on the web 
* Creating accessible designs

As a part of DCFemTech's October Tour De Code and a partnership between DCFemTech, Women Who Code, and AIGA.
