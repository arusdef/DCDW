  DC Design Week is led and produced by AIGA DC, the local chapter of the professional association for design. AIGA advances design as a professional craft, strategic advantage and vital cultural force.

  The DC chapter was formed in 1984, and is run by a volunteer board of directors. With over 1,230 members, AIGA DC is the fifth largest and one of the oldest chapters in the nation. We strive to cultivate, connect and celebrate the diverse work and people that make up our DC creative community.

# About

---

Every year, AIGA DC develops a week of fantastic programming, from workshops, panels, studio tours, lectures, and more to celebrate design in our community. This year, we’re taking it a step further by celebrating design more broadly and inclusively—design as built spaces, social impact, creative strategy, technology, craft, the arts, and the list goes on. This definition of design better reflects DC's creative community as a whole. To that end, we're partnering with organizations who share our values of community, connectivity, and diversity, to celebrate our city and our people.
