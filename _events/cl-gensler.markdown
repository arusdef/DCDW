Join AIGA DC for a series of DC Design Week lunches, as we open the doors to some of the DC areaâ€™s creative studios, agencies, and galleries. Grab a bite and get a behind-the-scenes look at some colorful spaces, see works in progress, compare office cultures and methodologies, and rub elbows with creatives whom you might not meet otherwise!

**Lunch is included. ** Registration is $10, limited to 50 attendees and is open to **AIGA members first!**

Please plan to arrive at Gensler 10 minutes early to allow time for registration, lunch and swapping stories with other designers. The presentation will begin promptly at noon.
