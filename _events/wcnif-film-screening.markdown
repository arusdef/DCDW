Join AIGA DC and Deloitte Digital as we explore *"What Comes Next"* in a private screening of a recent web documentary film. Come for the movie, stay for the popcorn and conversation.

*What Comes Next Is the Future* is a documentary film about the web created by Bearded founder Matt Griffin. It is the story of Tim Berners-Lee’s creation—how it came to be, where it’s been, and where it’s going – as told by the people who build it.

In the film, Griffin knits together a narrative by mining dozens conversations with important figures from throughout the web’s history including Jeffrey Zeldman, Denise Jacobs, Tim Berners-Lee, Ethan Marcotte, Chris Wilson, Lyza Danger Gardner, Eric Meyer, Irene Au, Alex Russell, Trent Walton, Val Head, Jonathan Snook, and many more.
