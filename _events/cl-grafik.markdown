  speaker-name: Hal Swetnam
  speaker-title: SVP, Creative Strategy
  speaker-bio-text: |-
    Veteran creative director, occasional voice talent, and incessant whistler, Hal is Grafik’s top creative strategist. Early in his career, he created memorable advertising campaigns for such notable brands as Hilton, Exxon Mobil, and National Geographic. Now, nearly 30 years later, he’s spending most of his time in board rooms working through brand strategies with C-suite executives. Always eager to tackle another corporate mantra, Hal helps clients articulate the one truly authentic principle that’s relevant to all audiences and stakeholders.

    His work separates Grafik from other branding firms, and distinguishes our clients from every competitor. He’s been an essential part of Grafik for nearly 15 years, leading naming efforts, overseeing the development of powerful brand identities, and helping to establish some of our most transformative strategies, including our work for JK Moving Services, The Neighborhoods of EYA, CFF, WTOP, and The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.

    refreshingly, and convincingly. Not a bad talent for someone who helps his clients
    develop their own unique story. In his 20 years of strategic creative direction,
    he has crafted image-rich narratives for brands like Strayer University, PhRMA,
    and U.S. Dairy Export Council. As one of the creative masterminds for EYA and
    JK Moving Services, he has developed brands that are the envy of their industries.

Nearest Metros are Braddock Road or King St. Old Town. Estimated walk time is 15-20 minutes. There is two-hour complimentary parking in the retail parking lot on the Pendleton Street side of our building. If coming from the DC/Arlington area via the GW Parkway, turn left on Pendleton and then take an immediate left into the retail parking lot directly behind Talbot’s clothing store. Talbot's is located on the corner of N. Washington Street and Pendleton (Bank of America is directly across from Talbot's). Of course if you are coming from the opposite direction you will need to turn right on Pendleton and then left into the retail lot. There is also three-hour street parking on Pendleton but there is no guarantee that spots will be available.
