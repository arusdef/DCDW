# About

---

Every year, AIGA DC develops a week of fantastic programming, from workshops, panels, studio tours, lectures, and more to celebrate design in our community. This year, we’re taking it a step further by celebrating design more broadly and inclusively — design as built spaces, social impact, creative strategy, technology, craft, the arts, and the list goes on. This definition of design better reflects DC's creative community as a whole. To that end, we're partnering with organizations who share our values of community, connectivity, and diversity, to celebrate our city and our people.
