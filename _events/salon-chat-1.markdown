    Morgan Hungerford West is an artist, content creator, and creative resource in Washington, DC.

    NYLON magazine has referred to Morgan's personal projects as "a virtual clubhouse representing DC's creative class." Since 2006 (and starting with her now decade-old blog, Panda Head) she has worked online to shift perception of DC creative culture \+ creative economy. Through the community-based A Creative DC project, Morgan uses social media as a means to connect the creative fabric of Washington; through the project's offline element she works to create platforms \+ discussions that assign value to creativity.

    An expert in user-generated content and online curation, she grew @aCreativeDC to an audience of 50k in 18 months, cultivating over a quarter of a million uses of the #aCreativeDC hashtag in the same amount of time. In 2016 she was tapped to launch @thisisMadeinDC in partnership with the government of The District of Columbia, amassing 10k followers on the channel in just 5 months, helping increase visibility of the over 150 locally-owned businesses enrolled in the city-backed program.

    She is really good at making things look really good, online and off, IRL and on camera. Refinery29 described her as a "visual genius," and with a background in display and merchandising, she's created immersive, interactive, engaging (and Instagrammable) environments for REI, St. Germain, Sydell Group, and the Kinfolk brand at events spaces across the country.
