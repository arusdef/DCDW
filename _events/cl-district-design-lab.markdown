## About District Design Lab

DDL is a collaborative group of designers connected by a shared curiosity in exploring different ways to impact social engagement using their collective skill set. The group is interested in pushing design outside of the orthodoxy of DC/corporate office work and out into the public realm more as a way of reminding people that design here isn't just for a specific clientele. Experimentation plays an important role in the group's work and the LAB part of DDL cannot be understated.

Nearest Metro is Brookland-CUA. The studio is located on the Art Walk street level.
