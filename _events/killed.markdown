As designers, we've all seen great work buried, either by clients, budgets, or supernatural influences. Have you ever wondered what happens to work once it’s “killed"? Is every trace of its existence buried beneath a labyrinth of mislabeled dropbox folders, or is there hope that artistic work can indeed live on?

We’ve tapped some of DC’s creative elite - including [Soung Wiser](http://generaldesignco.com/general/) of the General Design Co., [Brian Miller](http://www.streetsense.com/team/brian-2) and [Lauren Winter](http://www.streetsense.com/team/lauren) of Edit Lab @ Street Sense, and [Joey Marburger](http://joseph-jam.es/bio.php) of The Washington Post -  to be our guides as we explore the very existence of art and the temporality of our craft. Held at ISL's HQ in the historic Wonderbread Factory on October 27th from 6PM to 9PM, the public is invited to an examination of what causes ideas to get the ax, and how to move on.

Preceding our featured speakers, attendees will encounter a morbid medley of design including interior, interactive, product and print as they peruse our morgue of unpublished works submitted by local creatives

Waking the dead is thirsty business, so we’ll end the night with a “Burial at Sea” at All Souls Bar nearby. Hope to see you there - it'll be an event to die for.
