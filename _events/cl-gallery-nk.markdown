##About Gallery NK 
Gallery NK is the creation of Turkish-born artist Nihal Kececi. She found an old warehouse in the alley off K Street Northeast and turned it into a chic and modern gallery that doubles as her residence. Kececi showcases different artists from around the world each month, by appointment only.
