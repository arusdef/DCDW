you-are-voting-body-text: This civic engagement initiative wields the power of design
  to motivate the American public to register and turn out to vote in the 2016 general
  election, as well as local elections to come. The core of the campaign is an online
  gallery of original, nonpartisan posters generated by AIGA members for printing
  and public distribution. It is vital to the spirit, impact, and accessibility of
  this campaign that posters are nonpartisan and in window card format (portrait,
  11x17 inches).
