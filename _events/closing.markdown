## DCDW Wrap Party Extravaganza

Our week of celebration culminates in a day festival featuring crafty activities from local vendors, bocce, corn hole, and pumpkin fun!

Meet the DCDW team Saturday, October 29th at Union Market's newest outdoor beer garden, Tap & Garden, to raise a glass and toast to this year's DC Design Week. Together, we'll enjoy an afternoon of local crafts, food, drinks, and the company of fellow DC artists.

## Bring Everyone!

Guests of all ages are welcome, so bring your family, friends, coworkers, and roommates, and get those October vibes going with some fall festivities.

## Burgers by Chef Elias

The amazing, Michelin-star-winning Chef Elias Taddesse will be grilling up burgers that will blow your mind with his new concept menu.

## Hands-on Screen Printing: Drink & Ink sponsored by Soul & Ink

Soul & Ink is the brainchild of husband-and-wife design team, Frankie and Sherry Meneses. Passionate about design for social change, they wanted to find a means to step away from the computer and into the community. They were inspired to create a mobile screen-printing set-up after seeing how thrilled their friends were at screen-printing parties they hosted at home.
