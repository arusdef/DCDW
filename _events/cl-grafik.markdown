## What’s behind the best brand identities?

Grafik believes every branding engagement must start with a solid strategy that clearly informs a powerful creative approach.

Meet the designers and strategists who ensure our clients always land on The Right Idea.

**Lunch is included.** Registration is $10, limited to 25 attendees. Priority registration for AIGA members opens at noon on October 4th. General registration opens at noon on October 6th.

Nearest Metros are Braddock Road or King St. Old Town. Estimated walk time is 15-20 minutes. There is two-hour complimentary parking in the retail parking lot on the Pendleton Street side of our building. If coming from the DC/Arlington area via the GW Parkway, turn left on Pendleton and then take an immediate left into the retail parking lot directly behind Talbot’s clothing store. Talbot's is located on the corner of N. Washington Street and Pendleton (Bank of America is directly across from Talbot's). Of course if you are coming from the opposite direction you will need to turn right on Pendleton and then left into the retail lot. Just so you know, there is also three-hour street parking on Pendleton but there is no guarantee that spots will be available.
