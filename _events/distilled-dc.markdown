Distilled DC is an event for studio founders, principals, and seasoned creatives whose vision, leadership, and hard work over the years have made the DC metro area a creative hub worth celebrating all week. However, this evening is more than a chance for old friends to re-connect with each other and with AIGA. It is our way of saying "thank you" that's meant to lastâ€”dinner will include a generous helping of design thinking, as each table discusses how AIGA DC can better facilitate ongoing knowledge sharing among the area's most experienced creatives. 

This event is limited capacity, please request an invite. We will accept requests starting October 4.
