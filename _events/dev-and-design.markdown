## Bridge the Gap

As a part of DCFemTech’s [October Tour De Code](http://dcfemtech.github.io/tourdecode) and a partnership between DCFemTech, Women Who Code, and AIGA DC, this panel aims to bridge the gap between developers and designers through conversation, discovery, and a hands-on workshop. 

We’ll start off with an interactive panel discussion where developer and designer pairs will analyze existing designs and discuss their thoughts; this discussion will present perspectives from both development and design backgrounds. Then we will break out into four roundtable discussion groups, each of which will discuss the following:

* Getting started on creating your portfolio 
* Designers helping developers on the best way to design their portfolio 
* Developers helping designers get their portfolio up on the web 
* Creating accessible designs
