## Silk Screening with Soul & Ink

Soul & Ink is the brainchild of husband and wife design team, Frankie and Sherry Meneses. Passionate about design for social change, they wanted to find away to step away from the computer and into the community. They were inspired to create a mobile screen printing set-up after seeing how thrilled their friends were at screen printing parties they hosted at home. It was an instant hit! Live screen printing takes your event to the next level, with an undeniable cool factor and an interactive experience that will have your crowd buzzing for days.
