What's black and white and drawn all over? &pizza boxes!

Make it personal. Keep it fresh. Elevate everything. Celebrate oneness. These are the guiding principles for &pizza, and that's what makes them an awesome partner for DC Design Week.

Join AIGA DC, &pizza and your fellow creatives to design your own pizza box. Show off your mad skills, eat, drink and win some prizes throughout the night. Only ruleâ€”the designed box has to be black and white. The color is in the pizza. Snag a spot before this event fills up!

Your ticket includes drinks and food supplied by &pizza, as well as blank pizza boxes and drawing supplies.
