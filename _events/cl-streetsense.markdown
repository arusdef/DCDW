Streetsense is an experience-focused strategy and design collective. Experts in the real estate, retail, and hospitality industries, they create brands people love and places people love to be. With an un-disciplined approach and an insight-driven worldview, they impact experiences at every level and at every scale â€“ from neighborhood restaurants to city blocks. Join them for a luncheon to discuss what they do at Streetsense, what inspires them, and some of their very favorite projects.

**Lunch will be provided. ** Registration is $10, limited to 25 attendees and is open to **AIGA members first!**

Please plan to arrive at streetsense 10 minutes early to allow time for registration, lunch and swapping stories with other designers. The presentation will begin promptly at noon.
